# Code of Conduct - Code for Japan
日本語原文は[こちら](https://github.com/codeforjapan/codeofconduct)

## Introduction
This guideline is intended to make events organized by Code for Japan a comfortable place for all participants. To ensure the safety of participants, it is necessary for everyone to understand various forms of harassment, which can sometimes be unintentional. Regardless of how long you have been participating, there are things we all need to be mindful of. Keep these guidelines in mind to make the event enjoyable for everyone.

## What is Harassment?
Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal or text comments related to gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion. It also includes actions like continuously interrupting conversations, unfairly excluding others, demeaning language or actions, asserting superiority, intentional intimidation, stalking, taking inappropriate photographs or recordings, inappropriate physical contact, and exposure of sexual images in public spaces.

### Who is Subject to This Code?
This Code of Conduct applies to all event participants including attendees, speakers, staff, and sponsors. Additionally, it encompasses interactions using communication tools related to the events.

## Expected Behavior
**Respect others**: Engage with others in a way that allows them to work positively and productively, regardless of technical inclination. Use 'yes / and' instead of 'no / but' while respecting each other's opinions.

**Value contributions**: Recognize the value in everyone's ideas, skills, and contributions, appreciating and enjoying differences.

**Encourage dialogue**: Listen more than you speak, and do not assume everyone shares the same context.

**Responsibility in Actions and Expressions**: Please refrain from discrimination, defamation, and harassment. This includes gestures and online discussions (such as on Twitter, Slack, etc.). Also, be mindful that your display name, icons/avatars, and any visuals in your background during online streams can be visible to others, and you are responsible for their usage. Ensure compliance with laws (especially copyright laws) and this code of conduct (particularly regarding harassment).

**Understanding Each Other's Background**: We must remember that we all come from different cultural and personal backgrounds. What may be insignificant to you might be inappropriate for someone from a different background. When in doubt about what is appropriate, engage in dialogue.

## Unacceptable Behaviors
- Derogatory Language: We do not tolerate harmful language related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, race, religion, age, or socioeconomic status. This includes intentionally using specific pronouns such as "he/she" for someone whose gender is not clear, without their confirmation. Avoid making assumptions and expressions based on your own values, which might not be appropriate for others. If unsure whether language is derogatory, do not use it.

- Sexual Behavior: We do not tolerate drawing attention through sexual topics. This includes sexual comments, jokes, sharing or distributing images. Do not presume someone's gender based on appearance to advance a conversation or make sexual remarks based on your values. Also, non-consensual physical contact or implied physical contact (such as through text messages or emojis suggesting hugs or kisses) is not permitted.

- Disruptive Behavior: Actions that interrupt events, including lectures and presentations, are not permitted. This also covers irrelevant comments or questions during sessions and encourages excessive alcohol consumption or mocking those who do not drink.

- Incitement of Unacceptable Behavior: Encouraging or condoning behavior that falls into these unacceptable categories is equally reprehensible as engaging in them yourself.

### If You Encounter Unacceptable Behavior
If a participant engages in harassment, organizers can take appropriate actions including expelling the offender from Code for Japan's activities, events, and digital forums. If you are being harassed, notice someone else being harassed, or have any other concerns, immediately contact the event organizer or a Code for Japan official. If you cannot contact the event organizer or forum administrator, or in an emergency, you may need to call the police or remove yourself from the situation. Event staff or Code for Japan officials will assist participants in contacting venue security or relevant law enforcement agencies, accompany them, or consider measures to ensure safety during the event and provide appropriate support.

### Contact Information

### Disciplinary Responses to CoC Violations
Note: The content may change based on feedback currently being solicited on the Code for Japan Slack channel.

### Purpose
The disciplinary responses to CoC violations are established and operated to ensure the healthy management of the community. They are necessary and appropriate to allow all participants, whether continuing or new, to engage in activities safely and securely. The purpose of these sanctions is not solely to penalize offenders but to facilitate introspection and behavioral change among all participants through proper implementation of the CoC in response to violations.

### Applicable Incidents
This covers all incidents related to Code for Japan-hosted events and communications, as well as activities on online tools managed by Code for Japan, regardless of whether they occur offline or online.

### Process for Disciplinary Action
Initial responses to violations or inquiries will be handled by the CoC officer of Code for Japan. If a violation is reported, the auditor and the CoC officer will conduct an investigation. The results of this investigation will be presented to a temporary board of directors convened by the auditor. The board will then decide on the disciplinary actions. Typically, the chairperson of this board will be the representative director. However, if the chairperson is absent or it is inappropriate for the representative director to serve as chair, the auditor will assume this role.

### Handling of Information
The CoC officer will handle all information related to incidents carefully, following the privacy policy of Code for Japan, ensuring that victims, reporters, and consultants do not suffer any disadvantage.

## Types of Actions and Specific Responses

| Type of Action | Anticipated Situations | Specific Responses |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Caution        | No violation reported, or violation deemed very minor | Conduct investigations and respond without further action, retaining a record of the caution. |
| Warning        | Violation reported, or violation not considered minor | Restrictions on certain activities related to events for a decided period by the board. Further actions include: No participation in Code for Japan-hosted events without prior permission from the CoC officer, and involvement as staff, speaker, or sponsor is not allowed. No public disclosure of the case, but parts of the information (anonymized) might be used for awareness and as reference cases. |
| Temporary Ban  | Violation reported, and violation considered severe | No participation in events (including roles as staff, speakers, or sponsors) for a decided period. Additional actions include: Anonymous disclosure of the case and its penalties, followed by an indefinite ban if another violation occurs post-temporary ban. |
| Indefinite Ban | Violation reported, and violation considered extremely severe (including criminal offenses) | Consideration of legal actions and an indefinite ban from events. The case may be disclosed publicly (anonymously or not depending on the case). |
